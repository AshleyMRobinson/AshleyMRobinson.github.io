Lease Utilization & Risk Analytics

This project simulates a real-world SQL analysis of commercial lease performance across U.S. regions. It includes occupancy trends, underutilization patterns, and financial risk forecasting using raw CSV data.

Summary Report

Using SQLiteStudio, I queried and summarized 500 properties across a 7-day window to find:
- Average occupancy rate by region
- Properties underutilized (under 40%)
- Total revenue at risk
- Renewal probability forecasting

Skills Demonstrated
- SQL: SELECT, GROUP BY, AVG(), SUM(), CASE, ROUND(), ORDER BY
- Data cleaning and grouping
- Financial risk calculation
- Local SQL database use (SQLiteStudio)
